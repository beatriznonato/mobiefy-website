# Mobiefy 🛵

 ## Description
 To consolidate our presence and provide a more detailed view of the key features of the Mobiefy app, we developed a dedicated [website](https://mobiefy.netlify.app). The site aims to highlight Mobiefy and explain its main features, such as multimodal route integration and flexibility to address specific mobility needs. Additionally, the site offers clear and accessible information on how the app facilitates route planning and enhances urban mobility.

Through this platform, we aim to reach a broader audience and provide in-depth details on how Mobify can benefit its users.
